# FGOCrawler
---
I'm a big Fan of Fate Grand Order (FGO) mobile game,
recently I made a FGO Draw Card simulator in my github, but it only shows the text.
So I'm thinking if we can get a 'real' card draw? -> then we have this crawler program to crawl the pitctures/videos from FGO wiki page.

Main page of FGO wiki: (with Chinese language)
